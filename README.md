# nexmo-pubnub.cljs

Clojurescript based reference SPA on Heroku based on Nexmo and Pubnub,
using node express, bootstrap, reactjs/reagent and Kioo templates,
demonstrating "isomorphic" clojurescript shared between frontend and backend
and [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) hotloading code changes to both.

## Demonstration

Open the demo monitor page at https://nexmo-pubnub.herokuapp.com

To test out the monitoring and alert functionality,
create device emulators by clicking the **+Emulate Device**
button on the navigation bar of the demo page.
The device emulators run in the browser,
sending randomly created messages on the pubnub channel
used to monitor devices.

Open a second demo page using the url above (optionally on another computer).
Verify that the emulated devices are displayed and updated on the second page.
You may create additinal devices on this second page, which will show up on
any other open demo monitor.

## Deploy to Heroku

These instructions assumes you already have installed [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command).
To configure and start a server on Heroku:

    heroku apps:create
    heroku addons:create pubnub
    heroku config:set NEXMO_KEY=<nexmo-key>
    heroku config:set NEXMO_SECRET=<nexmo-secret>
    git push heroku master
    heroku open

This will open the site in your browser.

## Run Locally

To start a server on your own computer using the environment config from heroku:

    heroku config -s >> .env
    heroku local:run lein do clean, deps, compile
    heroku local

Point your browser to the displayed local port.
Click on the displayed text to refresh.

## Development Workflow

Start figwheel for interactive development with automatic builds
and code loading while using the config from heroku:

    heroku local:run lein figwheel app server

Wait until Figwheel is ready to connect, then
start a local server in another terminal as explained in
another section.

Open the displayed URL in a browser.
Figwheel will push code changes to the app and server.
